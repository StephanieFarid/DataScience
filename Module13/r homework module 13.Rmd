This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
meta<- data.frame(
    sex = rep(c("M", "F"), 6),
    stage = rep(c("I", "II", "II"), 4),
    treatment = rep(c("A", "B", "P"), each=4),
    myc = c(2343,457, 4593, 9035, 3450, 3524,958, 1053, 8674, 3424, 463, 5105)
)
row.names(meta)<-paste("sample", row.names(meta), sep="")
print(meta)
```
```{r}
meta[ , c(1,3)]
meta[c(5,7,9,10), 3]
 subset(meta, treatment == "P")
 subset(meta, myc > 5000, select = c("stage", "treatment"))
 meta[, -3]
 meta[-7:-9, ]
 meta [1:6, ]
 pre_treatment <- c("T", "F", "F", "F", "T", "T", "F", "T", "F", "F", "T", "T")

   cbind(pre_treatment, meta)
   colnames(meta) <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
```
