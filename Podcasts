    Really interesting. Paul Le Roux developes open source code which others end up proffiting from. He goes on a crime spree. What I found most interesting was
    that he got away with it for so long because of his background in software. He committed online drug fruad, which would normally be caught and shut down by the
    web host, but since he hosted his own sites they never got taken down. Briefly mentioned was the fact that they sent scripts to Florida. This stood out to me
    because I used write about pharmaceuticals in Florida (also known as the "pill mill capital") and I have seen so many cases of this type of story, but never 
    anything like this.

    Very insightful. What stood out to me most was the fact that the data scientist speaking mentioned that anyone who wants to get into the feild should NOT study
    computer science in university. I think that this is super applicable, because being that we are in a bootcamp, I assume that most of the class did not study
    computer science. Personally I went to journalism school, and listening to this episode helped me feel a little bit at ease and took off some of the edgyness I 
    felt that may have been imposters syndrome.
